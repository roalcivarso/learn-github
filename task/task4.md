# GitHub: Step-by-Step Guide

## 4. Basic GitHub Operations

### 4.1 Star: Understanding and using the "Star" feature

1. Log in to your GitHub account using your username and password.
2. Navigate to the repository that you want to star. You can find repositories by searching for specific projects or browsing through users' repositories.
3. Once you are on the repository page, you will see a button with a star icon located at the top-right corner of the screen, next to the "Watch" and "Fork" buttons.
4. Click on the star icon to star the repository. The star icon will turn yellow, indicating that you have successfully starred the repository.
5. Starring a repository is a way to bookmark and show your appreciation or interest in a project. It also allows you to easily find and keep track of repositories that you find valuable.
6. Starred repositories can be accessed later by clicking on your profile picture or avatar in the top-right corner of the screen and selecting "Your stars" from the drop-down menu.
7. On the "Your stars" page, you will find a list of all the repositories you have starred. You can filter the list by the repositories you have starred recently, repositories you have forked, or repositories owned by a particular user.
8. To remove a star from a repository, simply navigate to the repository and click on the yellow star icon again. The star will be removed, and the icon will turn back to its original outline.
9. Starring repositories is a personal preference and does not affect the repository owner or other users. It is a way for you to keep track of repositories that are important to you or that you want to revisit in the future.
10. Make use of the star feature to organize and manage your favorite repositories, discover interesting projects, and show support for the open-source community.

> Note: While starring a repository is a way to bookmark and indicate your interest, it does not automatically mean that you are contributing to or collaborating on the project. If you want to actively contribute, consider forking the repository and creating pull requests with your proposed changes.

### 4.2 Fork a repo: Creating a forked repository and contributing to open-source projects

1. Log in to your GitHub account using your username and password.
2. Navigate to the repository that you want to fork. You can find repositories by searching for specific projects or browsing through users' repositories.
3. Once you are on the repository page, you will see a "Fork" button located at the top-right corner of the screen, next to the "Star" and "Watch" buttons.
4. Click on the "Fork" button. This will create a copy of the original repository, known as a fork, under your GitHub account.
5. After forking, you will be redirected to the page of your forked repository. This is a separate repository that you have full control over.
6. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client or GitHub Desktop. This will allow you to work on the code locally.
7. Make the desired changes or contributions to the forked repository on your local machine using a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
8. Commit your changes to the forked repository. This records the changes you made with a descriptive message.
9. Push the committed changes from your local machine to the forked repository on GitHub. This updates the code in your forked repository with your modifications.
10. Once the changes are pushed, go to the forked repository on GitHub and navigate to the "Pull requests" tab.
11. Click on the "New pull request" button.
12. Review the changes that you made in the forked repository compared to the original repository.
13. Provide a clear and descriptive title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you made.
14. Submit the pull request, which sends a notification to the owner of the original repository, indicating that you would like your changes to be considered and merged into the original project.
15. The owner of the original repository will review your changes, provide feedback, and decide whether to merge your pull request into the main project.
16. If the owner approves your changes, your contributions will be merged into the original repository, and your work will be part of the open-source project.
17. Congratulations! You have successfully forked a repository, made contributions, and submitted a pull request to an open-source project on GitHub.

### 4.3 Cloning your forked repository: Cloning a repository to your local machine

1. Install GitHub Desktop on your computer by downloading it from the official GitHub Desktop website and following the installation instructions.
2. Launch GitHub Desktop and log in to your GitHub account if prompted.
3. Click on the "File" menu at the top-left corner of the GitHub Desktop window and select "Clone Repository" from the dropdown menu.
4. In the "Clone a Repository" dialog box, you will see a list of repositories associated with your GitHub account. Locate and select the forked repository you want to clone.
5. Choose the local path where you want to store the cloned repository on your computer. You can either use the default path or click on the "Choose..." button to select a custom location.
6. Click on the "Clone" button to start the cloning process. GitHub Desktop will download the repository files from GitHub and create a local copy on your machine.
7. Once the cloning process is complete, you will see the repository listed in the GitHub Desktop window.
8. You can now make changes to the repository files on your local machine using a code editor or IDE.
9. After making changes, go back to GitHub Desktop. You will see the modified files listed under the "Changes" tab.
10. Review the changes you made and enter a summary and description of the changes in the respective fields at the bottom of the GitHub Desktop window.
11. Click on the "Commit to main" (or a different branch if applicable) button to commit your changes to the local repository.
12. To synchronize your local changes with the forked repository on GitHub, click on the "Push origin" button.
13. Enter your GitHub account credentials if prompted to authenticate the push operation.
14. GitHub Desktop will upload your local changes to the forked repository on GitHub.
15. Your changes are now reflected in the forked repository on GitHub, and you can continue making further modifications or submit a pull request to contribute your changes to the original repository.

> Note: Cloning a repository using GitHub Desktop allows you to work with the repository locally, make changes, and easily synchronize those changes with the remote repository on GitHub. It provides a user-friendly interface and simplifies the process of version control and collaboration.
