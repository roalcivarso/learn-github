# GitHub: Step-by-Step Guide

## 11. Projects for a repository

### 11.1 Using GitHub Projects to manage and organize tasks within a repository

1. Sign in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository where you want to create a project board.

2. On the repository page, locate the "Projects" tab. It is usually located near the top of the page, next to other navigation tabs.

3. Click on the "Projects" tab to open the Projects page.

4. On the Projects page, click on the "Create a project" button.

5. Choose the type of project board you want to create. GitHub offers three options: "Basic Kanban," "Automated Kanban," and "Automated kanban with reviews." Select the one that best suits your needs.

6. Give your project board a name and optional description. You can also choose to make the project board public or private.

7. Click on the "Create project" button to create the project board.

8. Once the project board is created, you can start adding columns to organize your tasks. By default, you will have a "To do," "In progress," and "Done" column, but you can customize and add more columns as needed.

9. To add tasks or issues to the project board, click on the "+" icon in the corresponding column. You can create new issues directly from the project board or add existing issues from the repository.

10. Customize the tasks by adding labels, assigning them to collaborators, setting due dates, and adding additional information or comments.

11. As you work on the tasks, you can drag and drop them between columns to indicate their progress.

12. Collaborators can also interact with the project board, add comments, and move tasks to reflect their status.

> Using GitHub Projects, you can effectively manage and organize tasks within a repository, track progress, assign responsibilities, and collaborate with others to ensure a smooth workflow and project management process.

### 11.2 Change the repository associated with a GitHub Project. 

1. Go to the main page of the GitHub Project you want to change.

2. Click on the "Settings" button located in the upper-right corner of the project board.

3. In the "Settings" dropdown menu, click on "Change repository."

4. A dialog box will appear where you can search for and select the new repository you want to associate with the project.

5. Start typing the name of the repository in the search box, and GitHub will suggest matching repositories. Select the desired repository from the suggestions.

6. After selecting the new repository, click on the "Change repository" button to confirm the change.

7. GitHub will update the project board to reflect the new repository. Any existing tasks, columns, and settings will be transferred to the new repository.

> Please note that changing the repository for a GitHub Project will impact the project board and its associated tasks. Make sure to double-check and confirm the repository change to avoid any unintended consequences.
