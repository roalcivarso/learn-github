# GitHub: Step-by-Step Guide

## 9. Settings
GitHub web provides a settings page where you can customize and configure various aspects of your repositories and account. 

### 9.1 Managing repository settings

- Options: Here, you can configure additional options such as enabling or disabling issues, project boards, wikis, and other features.

- Branches: This section allows you to manage branch protection rules, default branch, and other branch-related settings.

- Collaborators: If you have collaborator access to a repository, this section allows you to manage and invite collaborators.

- Webhooks: You can set up webhooks to receive notifications or trigger actions when specific events occur in the repository.

- Actions: This section allows you to configure workflows and automate tasks using GitHub Actions.

- Security & analysis: Here, you can enable security features like code scanning and vulnerability alerts for your repository.

- Pages: If you want to host a GitHub Pages website, this section provides settings related to your website's configuration.

- Integrations & services: You can connect external services and applications to your repository using this section.

- Danger Zone: This section contains sensitive settings like deleting the repository or transferring ownership. 

Explore each section to modify specific settings according to your preferences. Once you've made the desired changes, save them by clicking the appropriate button at the bottom of the page.

### 9.2 Inviting collaborators to your repository

1. Sign in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository you want to invite collaborators to.

2. On the repository page, locate the "Settings" tab. It is usually located near the top-right corner of the page, next to other navigation tabs.

3. Click on the "Settings" tab to open the repository settings page.

4. In the left sidebar, click on "Manage access." This will take you to the page where you can manage repository collaborators.

5. On the "Manage access" page, you will see a search box under the "Collaborators" section. Type the username, email address, or full name of the person you want to invite as a collaborator.

6. GitHub will start suggesting matching users based on your input. Select the correct user from the suggestions.

7. Once you've selected the user, you can choose the permission level you want to grant them. The available permission levels are "Read," "Write," and "Admin." The permission levels determine the actions the collaborator can perform on the repository.

8. After selecting the permission level, click on the "Add [username]" button to send the collaboration invitation.

9. The user will receive an email notification informing them of the collaboration invitation. They will need to accept the invitation to become a collaborator on your repository.

10. Once the invitation is accepted, the user will have the specified permissions and be able to contribute to the repository.

> By inviting collaborators, you can enable others to contribute to your GitHub repository, collaborate on projects, and work together to build and improve your codebase.
