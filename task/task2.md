# GitHub: Step-by-Step Guide

## 2. Signing in to GitHub

### 2.1 Logging in to your GitHub account

1. Open your web browser and go to the GitHub website at www.github.com.
2. On the GitHub homepage, click on the "Sign in" button located at the top-right corner of the screen.
3. You will be redirected to the login page. Enter your GitHub username or the email address associated with your account in the provided field.
4. Below the username/email field, enter your password in the designated field. Make sure to enter it accurately, as passwords are case-sensitive.
5. If you want to save your login information for future convenience, you can check the "Keep me signed in" option. Note that it is recommended to use this option only on your personal device or a secure computer.
6. Once you have entered your username/email and password, click on the green "Sign in" button.
7. If the credentials you entered are correct, you will be logged in to your GitHub account, and the page will refresh to display your account dashboard.
8. Congratulations! You are now logged in to your GitHub account and can start exploring and utilizing GitHub's features for code collaboration, project management, and more.

### 2.2 Using two-factor authentication (2FA)

1. Log in to your GitHub account using your username and password.
2. Once you are logged in, click on your profile picture or avatar in the top-right corner of the screen.
3. From the drop-down menu, select "Settings" to access your account settings page.
4. In the left sidebar of the settings page, click on the "Security" tab.
5. Scroll down to the "Two-factor authentication" section and click on the "Set up two-factor authentication" button.
6. GitHub will provide you with two options: "Text message" or "Authentication app". Choose the option that you prefer.
   - If you select "Text message," enter your phone number and click on the "Verify" button. You will receive a verification code via text message. Enter the code in the provided field and click on the "Verify" button to complete the setup.
   - If you choose "Authentication app," GitHub will provide you with a QR code. Open an authenticator app on your mobile device (such as Google Authenticator or Authy), scan the QR code, and enter the code generated by the app into the provided field on the GitHub page. Click on the "Verify" button to complete the setup.
7. Once the setup is complete, GitHub will ask you to generate backup codes. These codes can be used in case you lose access to your two-factor authentication method. It is crucial to save these codes in a secure location. Click on the "Download" or "Copy" button to save the codes.
8. After generating and saving the backup codes, GitHub will prompt you to confirm your two-factor authentication setup by entering another verification code. This code can be obtained from your authentication app or via text message, depending on the method you chose.
9. Enter the verification code and click on the "Verify" button.
10. Congratulations! Two-factor authentication (2FA) is now enabled for your GitHub account. From now on, whenever you log in to GitHub, you will be prompted to enter a verification code generated by your chosen authentication method in addition to your username and password.

> Note: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your GitHub account by requiring a verification code along with your login credentials. It helps protect your account from unauthorized access, so it is highly recommended to enable and use 2FA for enhanced security.
