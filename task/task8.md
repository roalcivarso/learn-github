# GitHub: Step-by-Step Guide

## 8. Create a repo

## 8.1 Creating a new repository

1. Sign in to your GitHub account.

2. On the GitHub homepage, click on the "+" button in the top-right corner of the page. A dropdown menu will appear.

3. From the dropdown menu, select "New repository". This will take you to the "Create a new repository" page.

4. On the "Create a new repository" page, you will need to provide the following information:

   - Repository name: Enter a name for your repository. Choose a descriptive and meaningful name that reflects the purpose of your project.
   
   - Description (optional): Add a brief description to provide an overview of your project.
   
   - Public or private: Select whether you want your repository to be public (visible to everyone) or private (accessible only to you and collaborators).
   
   - Initialize this repository with a README: Check this option if you want to include a README file in your repository. The README file is a good place to provide information about your project, such as installation instructions, usage guidelines, etc.
   
   - Additional options: You can configure additional options like adding a .gitignore file, choosing a license, or enabling project management features like issues and project boards.

5. Once you have provided the necessary information and configured the desired options, click on the "Create repository" button.

6. GitHub will now create your new repository and redirect you to the repository page. Here, you can perform various actions related to your repository, such as adding files, making commits, managing branches, and more.

7. You can also share the repository link with others to collaborate or showcase your project. The link to your repository is in the format `github.com/username/repository-name`.

## 8.2 Commit your first change to the repository

1. Navigate to the repository where you want to make the change. You can do this by clicking on the repository name in your GitHub account or by searching for the repository using the GitHub search bar.

2. Once you are in the repository, locate the file you want to modify or create a new file by clicking on the "Add file" button if necessary.

3. If you are modifying an existing file, click on the file name to open it. If you are creating a new file, click on the "Create new file" button.

4. In the file editor, make the desired changes to the file. You can add, delete, or modify the content as needed. You can also format the text using Markdown syntax if desired.

5. After making your changes, scroll down to the "Commit changes" section. Here, you will see a text box to enter a commit message.

6. In the commit message, provide a brief description of the changes you made. It's a good practice to make the commit message clear and meaningful so that others can understand the purpose of the change.

7. Optionally, you can choose to include an extended description in the "Extended description" section. This can provide additional context or details about the change.

8. Once you have entered the commit message, review your changes and the commit summary that appears below.

9. Finally, click on the "Commit changes" button to commit your changes to the repository.

10. GitHub will now process the commit and update the repository with your changes. You will be redirected to the repository page where you can view the commit history, make further changes, or perform other repository-related actions.
