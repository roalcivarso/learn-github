# Hello World


I'm a Lecturer at  [Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)](https://www.utm.my/)  **passionate** *about* ~~education~~ and fostering a love for software development. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and contribute to the open-source community. Here's what I'm up to on GitHub:


-   🏆  [Working towards becoming a top GitHub contributor in Malaysia](https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users/blob/main/markdown/public_contributions/malaysia.md).🇲🇾
-   👥  [Committed to building a strong network within the developer community. Feel free to connect and share your ideas!](https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users/blob/main/markdown/followers/malaysia.md).
