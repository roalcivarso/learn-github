# Welcome to My Profile!

Hi! I'm Rizki Syaputra, Currently as **A Master Student at University Technology** in Malaysia. 

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. 📊💡

Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources, both internal and external. 📚

Data Cleaning: Ensuring data quality by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. 🧹

Data Analysis: Applying statistical and computational techniques to analyze data patterns and trends. 🔍

Data Visualization: Presenting data in visual formats like charts and graphs to communicate findings effectively. 📈

Machine Learning: Using algorithms to build models that can predict future trends based on past data. 🤖

Data Science plays a critical role in decision-making processes, transforming raw data into valuable insights. 🌟

Feel a little more knowledgeable about it now?

## KaTeX

You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

## UML diagrams

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```
