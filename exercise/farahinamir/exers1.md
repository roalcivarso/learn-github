You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights from data. ðŸ“Š It involves several key processes:

Data Collection: Gathering raw data from various sources.
Data Cleaning: Removing errors and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
Data Analysis: Applying statistical methods and algorithms to uncover patterns and trends.
Data Visualization: Creating visual representations of data to communicate findings effectively. ðŸ“ˆ
Machine Learning: Building predictive models to make data-driven decisions. ðŸ¤–
Data science is crucial in todayâ€™s world as it helps organizations make informed decisions, optimize operations, and innovate. ðŸŒŸ
