# Welcome to StackEdit!

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.


# Files

StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

## Create files and folders

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

## Switch to another file

### **Data Science** 🌐

**Data science** is a multidisciplinary field focused on extracting insights and knowledge from **data** using a combination of scientific methods, processes, **algorithms**, and **systems**. 🌐 It involves several key stages:

**1. Data Collection**: This is the initial step where raw data is gathered from various sources. 📊

**2. Data Cleaning**: Here, the data is processed to remove inaccuracies and inconsistencies, ensuring it is ready for analysis. 🧼

**3. Data Analysis**: Advanced statistical techniques and algorithms are applied to uncover patterns and insights. 📈

**4. Data Visualization**: The findings are presented in a visual format such as graphs and charts to make them easily understandable. 📉

**5. Machine Learning**: Algorithms learn from the data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. 🤖

**6. Data Interpretation**: The results are interpreted to inform decision-making and strategic planning. 🎯

**7. Communication**: The insights are communicated to stakeholders in a clear and actionable manner. 🗣️

Data science leverages tools and techniques from **statistics**, **computer science**, and **domain expertise** to help organizations make data-driven decisions.
