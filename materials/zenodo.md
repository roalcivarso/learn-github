# Zenodo :rocket:

## Zenodo Fundamentals :clipboard:

üî¨ Best research data and code-sharing practices are essential to promote transparency, collaboration, and reproducibility in scientific endeavours. Firstly, researchers should organize and document their data and code meticulously to ensure its comprehensibility and reusability by others. Implementing appropriate data and code licenses and clear usage terms fosters ethical and legal sharing. Choosing reliable platforms, such as Zenodo and GitHub, facilitates long-term preservation and access. :bar_chart: :closed_lock_with_key: :file_folder: :computer:

üîó [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is an open-access, general-purpose repository designed to preserve and share diverse research outputs effectively. Its primary role is to ensure long-term accessibility and citation of research data, software code, and publications, fostering open science practices. Researchers can deposit their work in Zenodo, which assigns each upload a Digital Object Identifier [DOI](https://apastyle.apa.org/learn/faqs/what-is-doi), making it easily citable in scholarly publications. This DOI is a stable link to the preserved version, safeguarding research outputs from data loss or unavailability. By providing a secure and publicly accessible platform, Zenodo promotes collaboration, reproducibility, and the dissemination of scientific knowledge across various disciplines, benefiting both researchers and the wider global community. :link: :newspaper: :floppy_disk:

## Integrating GitHub with Zenodo :octocat:

üîÑ This integration enhances collaboration and reproducibility within the scientific community. As developers continue to update their code on GitHub, Zenodo creates a record of each release, capturing the state of the project at that moment. This enables others to access and cite specific versions of the code, promoting transparent and reproducible research. By combining the collaborative capabilities of GitHub with the preservation and citation features of Zenodo, the integration facilitates the seamless sharing and documentation of research software, fostering open-source development and accelerating scientific progress. :file_folder: :link: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

## Using Zenodo with GitHub :octocat:

üîò Step 1: **Sign up and create accounts** :pencil2:
   - Create a GitHub account if you don't have one. :ballot_box_with_check:
   - Create a Zenodo account or log in using your existing GitHub credentials. :ballot_box_with_check:

üöÄ Step 2: **Create a new release on GitHub** :rocket:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub. :ballot_box_with_check:
   - Click on "Releases" in the repository menu. :ballot_box_with_check:
   - Click on "Draft a new release." :ballot_box_with_check:
   - Enter the release tag version, title, and description. :ballot_box_with_check:
   - Click "Publish release" to create the release. :ballot_box_with_check:

üéâ Step 3: **Zenodo DOI assignment** :medal_military:
   - Once you publish the release, Zenodo will automatically create a DOI for the release. :ballot_box_with_check:
   - Zenodo will also create a snapshot of the repository at that release version, ensuring preservation. :ballot_box_with_check:

üìé Step 4: **Retrieve the DOI badge** :bookmark_tabs:
   - After the DOI is assigned, you will find a DOI badge associated with the repository on Zenodo. :ballot_box_with_check:
   - Copy the badge markdown code provided by Zenodo. :ballot_box_with_check:

üìù Step 5: **Add the DOI badge to your README** :memo:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub. :ballot_box_with_check:
   - Click on the "README.md" file to edit it. :ballot_box_with_check:
   - Add the DOI badge markdown code at an appropriate location in the README. :ballot_box_with_check:
   - Commit the changes to the README. :ballot_box_with_check:
