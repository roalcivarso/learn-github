# How to commit in Github and Github desktop?
To commit code changes in GitHub, you can use either the GitHub web interface or the GitHub Desktop application. Here are the general steps to commit changes using both methods:

### Using GitHub web interface:

1. Go to the repository where you want to commit changes.
2. Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository URL.
3. Open your local repository and make the changes you want to commit.
4. Stage the changes you want to commit by using the command `git add <filename>` or using the staging area in your code editor.
5. Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message using the command `git commit -m 'commit message'`.
6. Push the changes to the remote repository using the command `git push` or by clicking on the `Push` button in the GitHub web interface.

### Using GitHub Desktop:

1. Open the GitHub Desktop application and select the repository where you want to commit changes.
2. Make the changes you want to commit in your local repository.
3. Stage the changes you want to commit by clicking on the `Changes` tab in the GitHub Desktop application and selecting the files you want to stage.
4. Write a descriptive commit message in the `Summary` field.
5. Click on the `Commit to main` button to commit the changes to the main branch.
6. Click on the `Push origin` button to push the changes to the remote repository.

In both methods, it is recommended to follow the best practices for committing code changes, such as writing descriptive commit messages and committing frequently.

# When should we commit our code to Github?
You should commit your code in GitHub whenever you have made significant changes to your codebase. Committing your code in GitHub is an essential part of the software development process, and it allows you to track the changes you have made over time.

Here are some scenarios when you should commit your code in GitHub:

1. When you have completed a feature: When you have completed working on a new feature or functionality, you should commit your code to the GitHub repository. This helps in tracking the progress of the project and ensures that the code changes are properly documented.

2. When you have fixed a bug: When you have fixed a bug or issue in the code, you should commit the changes to GitHub. This helps in tracking the history of the bug and ensures that the code changes are properly documented.

3. When you have made significant changes: If you have made significant changes to the codebase, such as refactoring or restructuring the code, you should commit the changes to GitHub. This helps in tracking the progress of the project and ensures that the code changes are properly documented.

4. At regular intervals: It is a good practice to commit your code at regular intervals, even if you have not made any significant changes. This helps in tracking the progress of the project and ensures that the code changes are properly documented.

In general, it is recommended to commit your code often and to write descriptive commit messages that explain the changes you have made. This helps in maintaining a clear history of the project and makes it easier to collaborate with other developers.

# Provide best practises when committing to Github
Committing code changes in GitHub is an essential part of the software development process. Here are some best practices to follow during commit in GitHub:

1. Write descriptive commit messages: A good commit message should be concise, descriptive, and clearly explain the changes you have made. It should be easy to understand and should provide context to other developers who may work on the same project.

2. Commit frequently: It is recommended to commit code changes often, rather than making large commits. This helps in tracking the progress of the project and makes it easier to identify and fix bugs.

3. Test the changes before committing: Before committing changes to the main branch, it is essential to test them thoroughly to ensure that they do not break any existing functionality. You can run automated tests or manual tests to verify the changes.

4. Keep commits focused: Each commit should focus on a single change or feature. This makes it easier to review the changes and understand their impact on the project.

5. Avoid committing sensitive information: Do not commit any sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, in your code. Instead, use environment variables or a separate configuration file to store such information.

6. Review the changes before committing: Before committing the changes, review them carefully to ensure that everything is correct and all changes have been properly staged.

7. Use branches: It is recommended to use branches for making changes, so that you can work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Merge the branches into the main branch once the changes have been reviewed and tested.

8. Follow conventions: Follow conventions and guidelines for commit messages, such as the Conventional Commits specification. This helps in maintaining a consistent style across the project and makes it easier to understand the changes made in each commit.

# Agile development: When is it best to commit to Github?
Agile development methodologies emphasize continuous integration and delivery, which means that code changes should be committed to GitHub as frequently as possible. In an Agile development process, code changes are typically committed to the code repository several times a day.

In Agile, it is recommended to commit code changes whenever a new feature or functionality is completed, a bug is fixed, or when a significant change is made to the codebase. Committing code changes frequently allows other team members to keep up with the progress of the project and review code changes as they are made.

One approach that works well in Agile is to use feature branches. Each feature or user story can have its own branch, and developers can commit code changes to the branch as they work on the feature. Once the feature is complete and tested, the branch can be merged into the main branch. This helps to ensure that changes are properly documented and reviewed by the team.

It is important to ensure that code changes are properly reviewed and tested before committing to the main branch. This helps to prevent issues from being introduced into the codebase and ensures that the code is of high quality.

Overall, committing code changes frequently and following best practices for committing code changes are key to a successful Agile development process.
