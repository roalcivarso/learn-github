# GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It is a popular platform for collaboration and sharing of code among developers. GitHub was launched in 2008 and was later acquired by Microsoft in 2018.

GitHub provides a range of features that make it easy for developers to collaborate on projects, manage version control, and streamline their software development workflows. Some of the key features of GitHub include:

1. **Repositories**: GitHub provides a platform for developers to store and manage their code repositories. Each repository contains a collection of files that make up a project or a portion of a project.

2. **Pull requests**: GitHub's pull request feature allows developers to review and discuss code changes before they are merged into the main codebase. This can help ensure that code changes are of high quality and don't introduce bugs or conflicts.

3. **Issue tracking**: GitHub's issue tracking system allows developers to create and track bugs, feature requests, and other issues related to a project. Issues can be assigned to specific developers, labeled, and prioritized to help manage the development process.

4. **Collaboration tools**: GitHub provides a range of collaboration tools, such as inline commenting and mentions, that allow developers to communicate and collaborate on code changes in real-time.

5. **Continuous integration and deployment**: GitHub integrates with a range of continuous integration and deployment tools, such as Travis CI and CircleCI. This allows developers to automate their build and deployment processes and ensure that their code is always up-to-date and error-free.

6. **Project management**: GitHub provides a range of project management tools, such as boards, milestones, and deadlines, to help developers track and manage their software development projects.

7. **Analytics and insights**: GitHub provides a range of analytics and insights tools, such as code frequency graphs and commit activity charts, to help developers track their progress and identify areas for improvement.

8. **Documentation and Wikis**: GitHub includes features for creating documentation and wikis associated with projects. This helps developers maintain comprehensive documentation and share knowledge with other team members and users.

9. **Extensibility**: GitHub offers an extensive ecosystem of integrations, plugins, and APIs. Developers can enhance their workflow by integrating GitHub with various tools and services, such as project management platforms, code quality analyzers, and communication tools.

10. **Social Coding**: GitHub encourages social interaction and knowledge sharing within the developer community. Developers can follow repositories, star projects they find interesting, and contribute to open-source projects. They can also discover trending repositories, explore different programming languages, and learn from other developers' code.



Overall, GitHub has become a central hub for software development, particularly for open source projects. Its features and tools make it easy for developers to collaborate and share code, manage version control, and streamline their software development workflows.

## GitHub Cheat-Sheet
A GitHub cheat sheet is a reference guide that provides a quick overview of the most commonly used commands and features in GitHub. It can be a handy resource for developers who are new to GitHub or who want a quick reference to the most important commands and features.Some common items that might be included in a GitHub cheat sheet include:

1. [**Git commands**](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf): Many GitHub cheat sheets include a list of basic Git commands, such as git add, git commit, git push, and git pull. These commands are used to manage version control in GitHub repositories.

2. [**GitHub commands**](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/): The cheat sheet might also include a list of basic GitHub commands, such as git clone, git fork, and git merge. These commands are used to collaborate on GitHub projects and manage issues and pull requests.

3. [**Markdown syntax**](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/): GitHub uses a flavor of Markdown for formatting text in issues, pull requests, and README files. A cheat sheet might include a list of basic Markdown syntax, such as how to create headers, links, and lists.

4. [**Keyboard shortcuts**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts): GitHub has a number of keyboard shortcuts that can help speed up your workflow. A cheat sheet might include a list of common shortcuts, such as how to navigate between tabs, search for code, and create new files.

- [Github: webhosting](github-webhosting.md)

There are various remote repository hosting sites:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product)
- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

Follow the workflow at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) to set up a free account, username, and password. After that, [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) will help you create a brand new repository on GitHub.

  
This can be useful for keeping your local workspace up to date.

Merge conflicts are not uncommon when working in a team of developers, or on Open Source Software. Fortunately, GitHub has some good documentation on how to handle them when they happen:

- [https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-merge-conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-merge-conflicts)
- [https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)
  
You can also use [git rebase branchname](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to change the base of the current branch to be branchname

The git rebase command is a lot more powerful. Check out [this link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) for more information.
