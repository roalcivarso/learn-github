# Github Education: Copilot

GitHub Copilot is available to GitHub Education users, including both students and educators. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that uses machine learning to suggest code as developers type. It was developed by OpenAI in partnership with GitHub and is available as a plugin for Visual Studio Code and GitHub's own code editor, Atom.

GitHub Copilot is particularly useful for students who are just starting to learn programming, as it can provide them with suggestions and guidance as they write their code. It can also be helpful for experienced developers who want to increase their productivity and efficiency when coding.

By using GitHub Copilot, students and educators can save time and focus more on solving the problem at hand, rather than spending time writing repetitive or boilerplate code. It can also help reduce errors and improve the overall quality of the code by providing suggestions based on best practices and commonly used patterns.

It is worth noting that GitHub Copilot is still in the beta testing phase and may not be suitable for all use cases. However, it has the potential to be a powerful tool for developers, particularly those in the education space, as it can help accelerate the learning process and improve the quality of code being written.

## Features
GitHub Co-pilot is an AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write code faster and more efficiently. Here are some of the key features of GitHub Co-pilot:

1. AI-powered code suggestions: GitHub Co-pilot uses machine learning to suggest code snippets and complete lines of code based on the context of your code and your coding style.

2. Contextual awareness: GitHub Co-pilot is designed to be aware of the context of your code, including the programming language, libraries, and frameworks you're using, as well as the variables and functions in your code.

3. Natural language support: You can interact with GitHub Co-pilot using natural language. For example, you can type a description of the code you want to write, and Co-pilot will generate the code for you.

4. Integration with IDEs: GitHub Co-pilot can be integrated with popular IDEs like Visual Studio Code, allowing you to use it directly within your development environment.

5. Code review and editing: GitHub Co-pilot can also be used for code review and editing, helping you to identify and fix errors in your code more quickly and easily.

Overall, GitHub Co-pilot is a powerful tool that can help developers write code faster and more efficiently by suggesting code snippets and completing lines of code based on the context of their code. Its ability to understand natural language and integrate with popular IDEs make it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.
